      <h1>Music</h1>
        <p>Some music to give you some inspiration with your music making (or music enjoyment!).</p>
        <h2>Radiohead</h2>
        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2nTsKOXIVGDf2iPeVQO2Gm" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
        <p>Radiohead have been around longer than I have and they've tried lots of different styles of music over the years. <em>OK Computer</em> is still
        one of their best albums, but <em>In Rainbows</em> is very good as well. The lead singer, Thom Yorke, also has his own solo material.</p>
        <p><strong>Other favourite tracks:</strong> Nude, True Love Waits, Sit Down. Stand Up</p>
        <h2>Nirvana</h2>
        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1f3yAtsJtY87CTmM8RLnxf" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
        <p>A classic band that weren't around for long! Nirvana made grungey rock music that still sounds great today. <em>In Utero</em> is another great album.
        The drummer, Dave Grohl, went on to form his own band <em>Foo Fighters</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Other favourite tracks:</strong> Come As You Are, Lithium</p>
        <h2>Jimi Hendrix</h2>
        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2aoo2jlRnM3A0NyLQqMN2f" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
        <p>One of the world's most notable guitarists! Jimi Hendrix made some funky, soulful music and then
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U5dvC5qr6Y">set fire to his guitar</a>. <em>Electric Ladyland</em> is great but <em>Are You Experienced</em>
            is also brilliant.</p>
        <p><strong>Other favourite tracks:</strong> Crosstown Traffic, Are You Experienced?, Hey Joe</p>
        <h2>Portishead</h2>
        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3Ty7OTBNSigGEpeW2PqcsC" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
        <p>Christopher gave me a Portishead album after getting sick of hearing rubbish music blaring out my speakers. Dummy is eerie and mysterious, but has
            some amazing music on it. Their self-titled album, <em>Portishead</em> is also excellent.</p>
        <p><strong>Other favourite tracks:</strong> Sour Times, Wandering Star, All Mine</p>
        <h2>Basement Jaxx</h2>
        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5uTjEhlLv2YHNna0ojb5Az" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
        <p>Basement Jaxx made a lot of sessions doing homework a lot more enjoyable! They're all 00s dance although they still put an album out now and then.
            Probably one my first ventures into dance music and I still listen to them today.</p>
        <p><strong>Other favourite tracks:</strong> Bingo Bango, Do Your Thing, Mermaid of Salinas</p>
        <h2>Daft Punk</h2>
        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3H3cOQ6LBLSvmcaV7QkZEu" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
        <p>One of the best known electronic acts in the world, Daft Punk have a lot to answer for in dance and electronic music. They started in the 90s
            and have continued making great music since. <em>Homework</em> and <em>Human After All</em> are both great albums too.</p>
        <p><strong>Other favourite tracks:</strong> Robot Rock, Crescendolls, Around the World</p>
        <h2>Justice</h2>
        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/33yAEqzKXexYM3WlOYtTfQ" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
        <p>Justice popped up in the middle of secondary school for me and I played this album to death. Some of the most interesting electronic music even
            today, it feels funky and glitchy all at once. Their whole discography is worth a listen and other artists on the same label (<em>Ed Banger Records</em>) like <em>Mr Oizo</em> and
            <em>Busy P</em> are some of my favourite artists still today.</p>
        <p><strong>Other favourite tracks:</strong> Phantom Pt. II, DVNO, Civilization</p>
        <h2>Foals</h2>
        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1hca9kcz9s1lCz7xeRyx4r" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
        <p>Foals were also a favourite at secondary school, when they started out, they made twitchy "math rock" that had lots of interesting rhythms. These
            days they release slightly more normal rock music which still sounds brilliant. <em>Total Life Forever</em>, the follow up to this debut, and their
            latest album are both good listens too.</p>
        <p><strong>Other favourite tracks:</strong> Spanish Sahara, Two Steps Twice, Sunday</p>
        <h2>Arcade Fire</h2>
        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6Hmj7SrLRbreLVfVS7mV1S" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
        <p>Your Dad introduce me to Arcade Fire when I was about your age! They've been making huge, lush, rocky, orchestral music for over a decade now and have
            some brilliant albums that are really worth listening to. This debut and <em>Neon Bible</em> are my favourites.</p>
        <p><strong>Other favourite tracks:</strong> My Body Is a Cage, Ocean Noise, The Suburbs</p>
        <h2>James Blake</h2>
        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2bN58GareTPp89qlI9j0rk" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
        <p>James Blake is one of my favourite artists of this decade and might be interesting for you if you're looking to make music with computers and loop pedals.
            A lot of his early music is just him looping and pitch shifting his voice, playing piano and playing drum machines. His latest album, <em>Assume Form</em>
            was excellent and incorporates hip-hop a lot more.</p>
        <p><strong>Other favourite tracks:</strong> Life Round Her, CMYK, Can't Believe The Way We Flow</p>
        <h2>Aphex Twin</h2>
        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7o2AeQZzfCERsRmOM86EcB" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
        <p>Aphex Twin is another master of electronic music. Well known for producing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdvbyF0r9k">weird music</a> and even
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdvbyF0r9k">weirder music videos</a>, he's also very prolific and has made some beautiful electronic music. <em>Drukqs</em>
        is strange but great, and this album, <em>Selected Ambient Works 85-92</em>, is one of my favourite albums.</p>
        <p><strong>Other favourite tracks:</strong> Fingerbib, Avril 14th</p>
        <h2>Queens of the Stone Age</h2>
        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0UEMTz9APWfoJHdlXDeIzm" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
        <p>One of my favourite rock bands, they make noisey rock and frontman Josh Homme has a distinctive voice. Their albums <em>...Like Clockwork</em>,
        <em>Era Vulgaris</em>, and <em>Songs For The Deaf</em> are still on regular rotation in my house.
        <p><strong>Other favourite tracks:</strong> No One Knows, Fairweather Friends, The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret</p>
        <h2>The Avalanches</h2>
        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5ApWGNgkZ5QJo9hBfBTqHq" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
        <p>They've only released two albums in 18 years because they use so many samples of other peoples music to create their own totally different tracks.
            The Avalanches are a great example of electronic music mashing up old music to make something new and interesting. It goes to show you can make
            pretty much any sound into music!</p>
        <p><strong>Other favourite tracks:</strong> Frontier Psychiatrist, Colours, The Noisy Eater</p>
        <h2>A Tribe Called Quest</h2>
        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3Ti0GdlrotgwsAVBBugv0I" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
        <p>I've not mentioned a lot of hip-hop because it's notorious for being quite sweary as a genre (which your parents probably wouldn't appreciate me suggesting).
            However, A Tribe Called Quest don't swear a lot and are some of the revered artists in the game. <em>Midnight Marauders</em> is my favourite
            album, with its funky flowing instrumentals and great vocals. Still maybe keep this one in headphones though...</p>
        <p><strong>Other favourite tracks:</strong> We Can Get Down, Electric Relaxation, Lyrics to Go</p>

        <hr>
        <p>I could go on for hours but the above will probably get you started a few honourable mentions though:</p>
        <p><em>Glass Animals, Jamie XX, Gorillaz, Blur, Pulp, Jon Hopkins, Lianne La Havas, Moby, Little Dragon, Pink Floyd,
            Royal Blood, Talking Heads, Muse, Vampire Weekend, and Four Tet</em></p>
        <p>...and a few I haven't mentioned because they swear <em><strong>a lot</strong></em> but are really excellent artists nevertheless...</p>
        <p><em>The Prodigy, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, N.W.A, and Tyler The Creator</em></p>
        <p>Happy listening!</p>
